# REVT

This is a project that I have been working on but got stuck because I lack the technology or the skills needed to complete the task.

## What I wanted to achieve:

I wanted to create a *Real estate virtual tour* app where people would use actual VR headsets instead of the cardboard VR or scrolling on the phone on something that imitates VR to take a tour inside a house for example that is out for sale.

### Advantages:

  - People would get a sense of real spacing when it comes to viewing houses from a distance.
  - Reduced time for visiting houses. Insead put on a headset and visit 10 houses/hour instead of 1.
  - Visit houses or apartments in other countries without needing to go there or moving there then seeing it is now what you desired.

## Technologies used:

  - Blender where I uploaded scans made with a Matterport 3 camera to later tweak and create the 3d object.
  - Unity to import the object and create the VR Experience.
